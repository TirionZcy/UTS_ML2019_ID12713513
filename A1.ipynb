        "1.Introduction\n",
        "The full name of this paper is “Eigenfaces vs. Fisherfaces: Recognition Using Class Specific Linear Projection” by the authors: Peter N. Belhumeur, Joao~ P. Hespanha, and David J. Kriegman in 1997.\n",
        "\n",
        "Peter et al’s report deal with a face recognition system that reduces the error rate. They find that the current face recognition system has some problem which is images will deviate from the linear subspace due to the face is not a true Lambertian surface and produce a self-shadow. Therefore, they invented a \"Fisherface\" method and produced well classes, even under high-intensity illumination. Moreover, a large number of experimental results show that the error rate of their proposed \"Fisherface\" method is much lower than the Harvard and Yale face database test.\n",
        "\n",
        "This report will be divided into 5 different sections ,which are introduction, content, innovation, technical quality, application and X-factor, presentation and references, to evaluate Peter et al’s report.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.Content\n",
        "2.1 Fundamental knowledge and Challenge\n",
        "The research is about a new face recognition method which is not sensitive to large changes in light and facial expressions. The light contains not only the light intensity but also the direction and quantity of the light source. The main problems they need to attempted to solve is that some areas of the face will differ between different images. Although the image of the Lambertian surface obtained from the fixed viewpoint is located in the 3D linear subspace of the high dimensional image space under varying illumination, areas of shadows, guesses, and facial expressions often deviate significantly from linear subspace. Therefore, it is an unreliable result for face recognition.\n",
        "2.2 Four existing face recognition classification methods\n",
        "In their article, they introduced four existing face recognition classification methods and compare the current popular methods. \n",
        "\n",
        "The first method is Correlation. This method identifies the image in the test set by marking the closest point in the test set. If all images are normalized to zero and unit variance, then this process is equivalent to selecting the image associated with the test image. Moreover, in the normalization process, the results are independent of the factors such as the intensity of the light source. The disadvantage of this method is that the study set images and test set images need to be acquired under the same illumination. Therefore, this method cannot get the perfect answer in the case of changes in illumination. The second disadvantage is that the image of the test face must be associated with each image in the study, so the correlation is computationally expensive.\n",
        "\n",
        "The second method is Eigenfaces. This is a dimensionality reduction method, also known as the Karhunen-Loeve method. It minimizes linear projection by selecting a dimension, maximizing the dispersion of all projection samples and improving accuracy. Its specific expression is as follows:\n",
        "\n",
        "Figure 1: The final expression of Eigenfaces\n",
        "Among this,  is the maximum projection sample,  is the scattering of the transformed eigenvector {y1,y2...yn}, [w1,w2...wm] means a set of n-dimensional eigenvectors ofcorresponding to m largest eigenvalues. One disadvantage of this approach is that the interstage scattering due to intra-class scattering used for classification. It means if the lighting changes, most of the features from one image to the next will change.\n",
        "\n",
        "The third method is Linear Subspaces. The linear subspace algorithm achieves error-free classification under any lighting conditions without noise or shadow, and the surface obeys the Lambertian reflectance model. Compared with Correlation and Eigenfaces, Linear Subspaces is not affected by changes in lighting direction. Its specific expression is as follows:\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Figure 2: The final expression of Linear Subspaces\n",
        "For each face, three or more images taken in different illumination directions are used to construct the three-dimensional basis of the linear subspace. The disadvantage of this method is that some areas in the face image have variability that they do not have. Linear subspace models need to take into account enough facial images, so you need to know which areas are good for recognition and which are not. Moreover, in order to identify the test image, the distance of each person's linear subspace must be measured. Finally, from a storage perspective, the linear subspace algorithm must preserve three images for each person. It means it will occupy a lot of memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "The last method is Fisherfaces. The Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) theory based on Fisherface and the PCA used in the feature face are similar. They are all methods of mapping the original data to the low-dimensional space. LDA and PCA are all from the data. It is different from LBP to extract local texture features.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.3 Experimental\n",
        "In the article, the author mainly compares the above four methods from three aspects which are variation in lighting, variation in facial expression, eye wear, as well as lighting and glasses recognition. The space in the direction of the light source is arranged in a spherical shape and then sampled in increments of 15 degrees.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.3.1 Variation in lighting\n",
        "The first experiment was to verify that under variable illumination, if the face recognition algorithm takes advantage of the images of the Lambertian surface, they would work better. The specific experimental method is to determine that the face remains stable and is illuminated by a main light source from each of the selected pictures in the database. In the experiment, 330 pictures of five people (each 66 pieces) are used and five subsets were extracted to quantify the effect. The test results are shown in Figure 3:\n",
        "\n",
        "Figure 3: The final result of variation in lighting\n",
        "The conclusion reached is:\n",
        "(1)All algorithms work flawlessly when the light is close to the front. However, When the light is off-axis, there is a significant performance difference between correiation and Eigenface. \n",
        "(2)When the number of feature faces is equal to the size of the training set, the feature face method is equivalent. Since the performance increases with the dimension of the feature space, the performance of the feature face method should not be better than the correlation.\n",
        "(3)In the Eigenface method, removing the first three principal components produces better performance under variable lighting conditions.\n",
        "(4)Although the linear subspaces method has a low error rate, it needs to store more than three times the information and three times the time.\n",
        "(5)The Fisherface method is more accurate than the Eigenfaces method and has a shorter calculation time.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.3.2 Variation in facial expression, eye wear and lighting\n",
        "The second experiment is how these methods are compared under different conditions. The subjects of the study included women and men, all of whom may have glasses and some men will have beards. Moreover, some images have different expressions such as happiness, sadness, and surprise under the same ambient lighting. The test results are shown in Figure 4 and 5:\n",
        "\n",
        "Figure 4: The final result of variation in facial expression, eye wear and lighting\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Figure 5: The final result of variation in facial expression, eye wear and lighting\n",
        "As we can see, All algorithms have a good effect on face images. In particular, the Fisherfaces method has been greatly improved, and its error rate has dropped from 7.3% to 0.6%. When the method trains the entire face, the pixel corresponding to the face occlusion profile is selected as a good feature for distinguishing the individual. Face shape is an important feature in face recognition. However, as a practical illustration, if the background is too complex or the hairstyle is quite different, the recognition rate will be much lower and may even be worse than a closely tailored image. In addition, The linear subspace method is much worse in this experiment than the illumination experiment in the previous section. These images are more in the linear subspace due to changes in facial expressions. Because the Fisher Faces approach tends to discount the parts of the image that are meaningless to the individual.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.3.3 Glasses recognition\n",
        "In this experiment, 36 images of the database are included and half of them are glasses. The recognition rate is obtained by cross-validation. Figure 6 shows the error rates for two different methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "Figure 6: The error rates of PCA and Fisherface\n",
        "\n",
        "According to Figure 6, the recognition rate of PCA is very low, because in most cases, it classifies images with and without glasses into the same category. In contrast to PCA, Fisherface is suitable for finding glasses and ignoring other features of the face. In addition, it is expected that the same technique can also be applied to recognize facial expressions.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.4 Result\n",
        "(1)If an image similar to the image in the training set is rendered in the test set, all methods perform well. \n",
        "(2)The Fisherface method seems to be the best way to extrapolate and interpolate lighting changes.\n",
        "(3)Removing the three largest principal components does improve the performance of the feature surface method in the case of illumination changes, and does not achieve such a low error rate.\n",
        "(4)Under certain conditions, as the principal component increases in the feature surface method, its performance is close to correlation.\n",
        "(5)Fisherfaces seems to be the best way to deal with changes in lighting and expressions at the same time. As expected, linear subspace methods are affected when faced with facial changes.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.5 Analysis and summary\n",
        "Peter et al. (1997) state that even with this extensive experiment, there are some interesting questions, such as how the Fisher Faces method extends to large databases. In addition, current face detection methods may reduce the accuracy rate under intense lighting conditions, so new detection methods are needed to support the algorithm. Finally, when shadows occupy most of the face, the performance of all proposed recognition methods will decrease, and techniques for modeling or masking shadow areas may be needed.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.Innovation\n",
        "The contribution of the paper is to propose a new calculation method of Fisherface and compare it with other methods. In other words, this article upgrades the existing Fisherfaces algorithm for facial recognition. Peter et al. believe that their approach can significantly reduce the error rate in some cases.\n",
        "\n",
        "In my opinions, the method in the article by Badrul et al. cannot be said to be strong innovative. This view is mainly based on the following point.Fisherface is the basic theory that R.A. Fisher proposed in 1936. Moreover, Belhumeur et al. propose “Eigenfaces vs. Fisherfaces: Recognition Using Class Specific Linear Projection” in 1996. Although Peter et al.’s method can improve the accuracy, this method is an improvement of the original method rather than a completely new method. In addition, the article was released more than 20 years ago, which means that some people will release new methods for face recognition. For example, Dare et al. (2015) state that dimensional dimensionality reduction for face recognition applications using the LMS algorithm. Therefore, in my opinion, the practicality of this article is generally.\n",
        "\n",
        "4.Technical quality\n",
        "The quality of this new Fisherface algorithm is high, but there are still some challenges that need to be addressed.\n",
        "\n",
        "Peter et al. article proposes a Fisherface algorithm that, compared to the remaining three methods The algorithm can more effectively recognize a person's face, and in character expressions and character accessories (such as glasses and beards) have higher accuracy. In addition, this algorithm also has good results in the case of more shadows or different lighting positions. inally, the author extracts data from Yale and Harvard's face database and proves the accuracy of the algorithm. At the time, it can be said that it is a big step forward.\n",
        "However, the main problem with this research is the lack of validation of the data set. Peter et al. also propose the same question at the end of the article. The data set is the most important part of this experiment, all results and analysis are based on the data set. Although Yale and Harvard's face database have higher accuracy, Peter et al. have some doubts about the performance of extending the Fisherface method to large databases. Moreover, the author  believe that strong lighting will affect the accuracy of the algorithm, I believe that this technology may be difficult to solve at the time.\n",
        "\n",
        "5.Application and X-factor\n",
        "In my opinion, Fisherface technology can be applied to current face recognition technology. According to my research results, Fisherface is still the mainstream algorithm in face recognition technology. In particular, the method of Fisherface's overall dimensionality reduction mapping of original data to low-dimensional space is still the mainstream method. In my opinion, the author's future research direction should focus on the practicality of their proposed algorithms. In other words, how to apply this method to large databases and how to reduce the effects of intense light.\n",
        "\n",
        "On the other hand, this method can also be applied to other areas, such as gesture recognition. Gesture recognition should be more difficult than facial recognition because the images of the model are more similar. \n",
        "\n",
        "I think the work described in the paper can lead to a good discussion in the classroom. Because face recognition is becoming more and more popular in our lives. The main reason for the two prominent advantages of face recognition is that it is widely used. The first point is security. Face recognition does not require intimate contact between the face and the recognizer. Therefore, personal information is leaked less, so it is difficult for others to collect enough details to make a fake face. The second point is convenience. Users do not need extra action and are available for all ages. The above two points are also the reasons why I am interested in face recognition. Because this technology may fundamentally make our lives easier and safer.\n",
        "\n",
        "6.Presentation\n",
        "The level of this article is of high standard. In the overall aspect, this paper first analyzes four mainstream face recognition systems, the research object is the influence of light and facial expression on face recognition accuracy. Secondly, The author helps the reader to understand the four methods and introduces the algebra in the mathematical formula in the paragraph. Each chapter of this article has a corresponding title, which is easy to find when viewing specific target content.\n",
        "\n",
        "In terms of content, the author shows the results of the experiment through a pattern of tables and graphs. This method allows the reader to make the experimental results clearer and easier to understand. The author will also introduce their strengths and weaknesses at the end of each method so that readers can compare.\n",
        "\n",
        "But after reading the full article, I still have some questions:\n",
        "(1)The author's description of Fisherface is not very detailed, I need to read other articles.\n",
        "(2)As mentioned before, Is the timeliness of the article still be useful? Because this article was completed in 1997.\n",
